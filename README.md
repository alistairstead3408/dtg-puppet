DTG Puppet Repository
=====================

Contains puppet configuration for DTG services.

To fully clone including submodules you need to do:
`git submodule init && git submodule update`

The copyright status of this code needs clarifying, it would probably have to be AGPL at the moment because we use some mayfirst stuff.

TODO
----
* Use cam.ac.uk ubuntu mirror
* Work out why egd is not being correctly ordered before gpg and monkeysphere
